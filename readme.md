# Objectives
This course teaches the basic principles of Model-Driven Engineering - MDE. Students should learn:

1. The fundamental concepts of MDE, its role in a critical system’s development and safety assessment processes, and the importance of having precise models in this context.
2. How to identify and write functional and non-functional requirements for critical systems, using the best practices and ensuring that they respect the expected quality standards (verifiable, traceable, unambiguous, correct, etc.)
3. Formal models capable of precisely capturing different aspects of UML diagrams, such as labelled transition systems and different logical systems.
4. Understand domain specific standards common in critical systems’ development, and apply them when using an MDE approach; and
5. How to use tools that support requirement specification and management, system modelling and its safety assessment, and the formal models described.


# Syllabus

1. Fundamental concepts and principles of MDE, and its specificities when applied to critical systems.
2. Fundamentals of requirement engineering.
3. UML as software and system modelling languages for enabling critical systems MDE.
4. Formal specification and model checking of critical systems: principles and tools.
5. Software development standards for critical systems.
6. Case studies.

<!-- 6. Fundamentals of testing and fault analysis, and its usage in MDE -->

# Pragmatics

### Remote and physical lectures

[To be confirmed:] This course unit consists of 11 weeks, each with 2h of theoretical and 3h of practical lectures. Due to the current pandemics, this course unit will have both remote and physical lectures:
 - all _theoretical lectures_ will be remote, via a video-conference tool (e.g., Teams or Zoom) ; and
 - every 2nd week the _practical lectures_ will alternate between being remote and physical, and in the last week there will be a 1.5h practical physical lecture.

### Evaluation

 * __Final mark__ = Individual Exercises (10%) + Group Assignments (60%) + Literature Review (30%)

__Individual Exercises__ are to be developed individually, submitted to a dedicated `git` repository. These exercises are included in the lecture slides. Marks will reflect mainly the effort, and the feedback will be provided during the practical lessons.

__Group Assignments__ are to be developed by teams of 4 students, each submitted together with a LaTeX report using a different dedicated `git` repository. There will be 5 assignments that cover different parts of this unit. Most work is expected to be done within the practical lessons. Feedback will be provided within 2 weeks after each submission deadline, and marked only at the end of the unit.

__Literature Review__ is to be developed by the same groups of 4 students, and consists of a written _critical_ review of maximum 4 pages using a LaTeX template that will be made available.
The review will be presented in an oral presentation, and the review will be partial evaluated by peers.

<!-- ### Evaluation

 * __Final mark__ = Group Project (70%) + Literature Review (30%)

__Group Project__ is developed by teams of 4 students, submitted together with a report using a dedicated `git` repository, divided into 3 parts (to be confirmed).

__Literature Review__ is developed by the same team, and consists of a written _critical_ review of maximum 4 pages using a LaTeX template that will be made available.

Both the project and the review will be presented in an oral presentation, and the review will be partial evaluated by peers.
 -->

### Deadlines

__Individual exercises__ must be submitted until Sunday @ 23:59 of the following week of being presented. For example, a set of exercises presented in the working week 2 Nov - 6 Nov must be submitted until Sunday 15 Nov.

__Group assignments__ have the following deadlines, that may still suffer changes.

  - __A1:__ tbd
  - __A2:__ tbd
